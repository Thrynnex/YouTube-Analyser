## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is structured for easy deployment on Vercel:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ youtube.js    # The secure backend serverless function
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # The main frontend file (HTML, CSS, JS)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE           # Project license
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Project documentation
```

-   The `index.html` file contains all the user-facing code. It sends requests to our own API endpoint.
-   The `/api/youtube.js` file is automatically detected by Vercel as a serverless function. It receives requests, securely uses the API key to fetch data from YouTube, and returns it to the frontend.
